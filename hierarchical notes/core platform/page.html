</head><body><ul><li><b>Parsing</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Support defining and overloading operators.</li>
<li>You should be able to specify the <b>fixity, arity, precedence</b>&nbsp;(or priority, or scope) and <b>associativity </b>of each operator and operload them.</li>
<li>Support for distfix operators.</li>
<li>Support juxtaposition.</li>
<li>Classification of tokens into <b>initiators</b>, <b>separators</b>, <b>terminators</b>&nbsp;and <b>operands</b>.</li>
<li>Operator associativity could be relevant for unary operators too, if you consider them as potential values. e.g. a!! ≔ (a!)! or a(!!) ?</li>
<li>Support associativity option that makes <tt>(a&lt;b)&lt;c ≠ a&lt;b&lt;c ≠ a&lt;(b&lt;c)</tt>&nbsp;and allows defining <tt>a&lt;b&lt;c</tt>&nbsp;as a<tt>&lt;b and b&lt;c</tt>&nbsp;(similarly for ⟶ (implies) and =)</li>
<li>Support mixing operators with the above associativity option. e.g. <tt>a&lt;b=c&gt;b</tt>.</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Maybe I can use the 0x2062 INVISIBLE TIMES Unicode character to simplify implementation of juxtaposition parsing.</li>
<li>Allow more than one associativity per priority?</li>
<li>I could decouple the insertion of names in a scope from the operator status of them. e.g. I could have a function named '+' with 'prefix' syntax, that would only be parsed as a prefix operator if the prefix + has been activated in the scope. Otherwise it would be parsed as a regular function.</li>
<li>Overloading the membership operator '.' like I've thought, should be similar but more powerful than D's opDispatch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Could I make the parser see the operators as functions when they appear by themselves in parenthesis or brackets (e.g. (+), [*], etc.), instead of using <b>op</b>&nbsp;or <b>operator</b>&nbsp;or something similar?</li>
<li>Make sure <tt>(flag ? x : y) += 5;</tt>&nbsp;is properly supported.</li>
<li>If I make the membership operator ('.') user-defined, how will I avoid confusion between a field and a variable with the same name? e.g. <tt>y</tt>&nbsp;in <tt>p.y</tt>&nbsp;with a variable <tt>y</tt>.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">One idea is to take the right hand side argument as an AST, use the name of the argument ("y") and ignore its type and address. That might allow a syntax like OpenCL's .yzxw as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Compilation</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li><b>Partial Evaluation</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>compile-time evaluation ⊂ partial evaluation ⊂ supercompilation. I'll probably need the latter!</li>
<li>It may be too expensive to interpret the functions during compile time. They might need to be compiled first. JIT compiler for the compilation, compiler for producing the executable!</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Attach compiler to executable to allow partial evaluation even during run-time?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Clarify semantics around side-effects in the context of partial evaluation / instantiation.</li>
<li>Clarify semantics around compile-time evaluation of floating-point expressions during cross-compilation, when target and host architecture floating-point models, don't match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For some properties like no escape of local addresses, synchronized, etc. it would be nice to give the ability to specify them, but I don't have to force constraints over the function structure. I could make them specifications that are guaranteed to be provable if the constraints are met, while they may be provable or not if the constraints they are not.</li>
<li>Compile header/interface files to binary headers and source files to object files respectively and archive them both in a single file.</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>How will a function gain access to the name of the function that called it and the line number, file name, etc. of the call site so that it can print an error message?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Intrinsics</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>HLT function?</li>
<li>Together with primitive operations for integer addition, subtraction, etc. counting of set bits of a number, and other usual machine instructions. It would be good to have machine vector operations and maybe some primitives for copying memory blocks and converting strings to numbers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>If I need to reserve space for objects at link-time, the ELF 'common' objects can help!</li>
<li>Define some sort of "Hardware Abstraction Language" that will be a little higher-level than an intermediate language and will replace build-in types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Clarify the semantics for "booting" or "bootstrapping" into the initial language. Probably have the internal data structures be initialized by a hard-coded default.</li>
<li>If the compiler hands off the integer literals to the "substrate" as strings so that they can be converted to numbers, then how will the substrate functions that do the conversion be written?</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Perhaps it can be done with the use of symbols like <tt>int.zero</tt>&nbsp;and <tt>int.one</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
