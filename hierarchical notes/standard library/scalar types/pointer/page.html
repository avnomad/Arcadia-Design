<title>Pointer</title>
</head><body><ul><li>A number of types:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>unique</li>
<li>shared</li>
<li>weak</li>
<li>restrict</li>
<li>garbage-collected</li>
<li>pointer type for pointing to objects that should never be freed. e.g. for pointing to stack objects and/or iterating over arrays. On the other hand 'weak' wouldn't free them anyway.</li>
<li>pointer type for pointing exclusively to objects allocated using new and can be deleted. (Won't automatically manage memory, but will be usable with <tt>delete</tt>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May be able to check ownership semantics of unique and other pointer types statically using a sytem similar to Rust's (and perhaps introducing the same concepts of borrowing and lifetimes).</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Should I also include reference versions of the above? e.g. UniqueReference?</li>
<li>Should I include Java-style references?</li>
<li>Should I include a raw address type (as a pointer or otherwise)?</li>
</ul>
