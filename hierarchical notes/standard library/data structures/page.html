<title>Data Structures</title>
</head><body><ul><li>Should have an <i>nElements</i>&nbsp;member that returns the number of elements in the structure. This might need to return infinite for some structures!</li>
<li>The same checks that are present in checked STL in debug mode should also be available here.</li>
<li>Those checks should be split into categories that can be enabled/disabled independently in a way that is available to client code.</li>
<li><b>Lists</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Support pattern-matching in definitions and assignments. e.g. [a,b] = [1,2].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Heaps</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>A heap must support key reduction and returning iterators to the heap elements, that don't get invalidated when elements are added/removed from the heap, for use with key reduction. (this is useful for implementing shortest paths, A*, etc. see CLRS for details)</li>
