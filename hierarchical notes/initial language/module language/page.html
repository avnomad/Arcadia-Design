<title>Module Language</title>
</head><body><ul><li><b>Model</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Suppose the compiler has somehow received a list of module search roots.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Typically that would include the current directory and one or more library installation directories.</li>
<li>Typically adding items to this list will be done by command-line arguments to the compiler.</li>
<li>Larger projects are likely to have multiple module search roots configured in their build configuration to facilitate organizing their source files. e.g. the following are likely to be under different roots:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>module interfaces (equivalent of C's .h files or D's .di files)</li>
<li>module implementations</li>
<li>unit tests</li>
<li>generated code (either stand-alone code or partial classes that are intended to be combined with code in module implementations)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suppose p is a path to a file that exists under at least one of the module search roots.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>If for all search roots r, r/p is a directory, then p represents a package else p represents a module.</li>
<li>If p represents a module, then all r/p that are regular files (what if they are not?) and all regular files under all r/p that are directories will be combined into the single module p as if by concatenating their contents.</li>
<li>Since top level statements are expected to be executed in lexical order, it's likely that the order in which individual files are combined into a single module is important. DFS dictionary order in each of the search roots in the order said search roots are given on the command-line should suffice.</li>
<li>Clients will refer to this module as p (not r/p). e.g. in <tt>import p;</tt></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Module and package declarations won't exist as they are redundant and lead to more work when refactoring.</li>
<li>The entire hierarchy of packages, modules and their contents will be semantically equivalent to putting everything in a single physical source file and using block statements for grouping.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>That should facilitate refactoring. e.g. when a file with internal organization grows too large and needs to be split into multiple files without breaking clients.</li>
<li>So e.g. a single file containing</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>+block</tt> std</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>+block</tt> colour</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>+block</tt> rgb</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"># rgb functions here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>−block</tt> rgb</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>+block</tt> hsl</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"># hsl functions here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>−block</tt> hsl</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>−block</tt> colour</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><tt>−block</tt> std</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">should be equivalent to the following hierarchy of files:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><span style="color: #5454ff">std</span><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: monospace"><span style="background-color: #ffffff"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace"></span></li>
<span style="font-family: monospace"><li style="list-style-type: none">└── <span style="background-color: #ffffff"><span style="color: #5454ff">colour</span><span style="color: #000000"> </span></span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> ├── hsl (contains rgb functions)</li>
</span><li style="list-style-type: none"><span style="font-family: monospace"> └── rgb (contains hsl functions)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The rest of the code will be able to import the module's symbols, or a subset of them, with an import statement (assuming they have been exported using an export statement first) inside a namespace (global, class, local, etc.). </li>
<li>It will also be able to qualify names with the path/url of a module, or declared aliases of that path/url, to refer to them directly, without importing them in a namespace. (e.g. to solve name conflicts) In the latter case, the module will be linked to implicitly.</li>
<li>In general, mutually recursive functions (and structures?) could be in different files, but they must be in the same module. That might mean that changing one causes everyone to be recompiled.</li>
<li><b>Notes</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>This model is somewhat similar to D's but:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>It effectively allows splitting a module into as many physical source files as needed.</li>
<li>It does not require special handling of <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/module.html#package-module">package modules</a>.</li>
<li>It allows more flexibility into organizing large test suites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This model should obviate the need for namespaces, includes and submodules.</li>
<li>There is ample motivation in larger projects to organize files under multiple roots. Even if the language can difference between production and test code and give correct test coverage results, it might be difficult for other tools (that e.g. count lines of code) to do so. It's also conceivable that linters should ignore generated partial classes or that coding standards and/or naming conventions are different for test vs production code. It's easier configuring different policies for different files if they are under different trees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>How will I avoid unnecessary recompilation in cases where there are mutually recursive functions?</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Perhaps I can have cyclic imports of functions and classes... Then according to the above, there must be ways to save compilation time. e.g. a workaround could be to compile a source file in separate header and object, taking care not to change the timestamp of the header if the contents do not change, and write the makefile so that the 2nd module depends only on the 1st module's header.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it's good to have the guarantee that there are no cyclic dependencies between modules... Perhaps I need to include some kind of submodules or accept that compilation time won't always be the least possible or take measures in the implementation so that cases where compilation time can be saved are identified and addressed properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should there be a way to refer to individual files being concatenated into a module?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Initialization</b> (and Finalization) <b>Order</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Variables inside the same module are initialized in the order they appear in the conceptual file.</li>
<li>The module import graph must be a directed acyclic graph. (here a reference to a module's symbol using a qualified name, counts as an import)</li>
<li>A modules variables are initialized after initialization of the variables of imported modules. (this is the same as for importing shared libraries)</li>
<li>Variables are finalized in the reverse order they were initialized.</li>
<li>Initialization includes calling the constructor and finalization includes calling the destructor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Execution</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>The interpreted program will start its execution from the beginning of the file (although declaration order should not matter for functions).</li>
<li>The compiled program will start its execution from the function marked as 'entry'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Module Initializers and Finalizers</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Namespaces</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Use the containing source file's path (URI?) to identify the namespace.</li>
<li>namespace &lt;alias&gt; &lt;URI&gt; declaration.</li>
<li>using &lt;alias&gt; | &lt;URI&gt; : &lt;identifier&gt;</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>I could use partial classes to implement namespaces that behave like they do in C++ (different parts of a namespace can be defined in other files or other parts of the same file) instead of building-in namespaces as a separate concept.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Should I merge the concepts of namespaces and includes like Java does?</li>
<li>Should I allow using <i>includes</i> to break large files into smaller ones?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Imports</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>import/using &lt;alias&gt; | &lt;URI&gt;</li>
<li><tt>+import, −</tt>import</li>
<li><tt>export import</tt></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Immediately exports again all the imported symbols. (transitive import)</li>
<li>Allows creation of "master module" files that will import all symbols from a number of smaller modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The difference between a using <i>declaration</i> and a using <i>directive</i>, isn't only that the former introduces a single name, while the latter all names, but that the former introduces only currently known names, while the latter introduces future names as well.</li>
<li>I'll probably not need something like <b>static import</b> (include) because my "includes" are done implicitly.</li>
<li>Allow importing modules (or dlls?) at run-time.</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>I can use disambiguators with patterns (like '*' in Java imports) in both imports and exports.</li>
<li>It should be possible for a module to import a specific version of another module. Then two modules importing different versions of a third module, should be importable by a forth module. e.g. An application A that is built against libraries B and C that are built against different versions of the standard library should work fine. Since symbols in a module are in a namespace that uses the path to the module file as a prefix, there should be no collisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Do I need <i>renaming imports</i> (from D), or will simple imports plus aliases suffice?</li>
<li>Will I need something like C++'s extern "C" to import unmangled names?</li>
<li>Do I want to decouple the logical packet structure from the physical folder structure? In other words do I want separate "include" and "using" commands?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Exports</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Use an <tt>export</tt> keyword instead of <tt>public</tt> to make a class or other entity visible to other modules / compilation units.</li>
<li>Support both <tt>+export, −export</tt> blocks and <tt>export </tt><i>function_name</i> constructs<tt>?</tt></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Includes</b></li>
<li><b>Submodules</b></li>
<li><b>Module Interoperability</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Define a standard ABI for communication across module boundaries. e.g. for propagating exceptions.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Or maybe an automatic translation from exceptions to error codes and back.</li>
<li>Define a standard name mangling so that modules compiled by different compilers can communicate.</li>
<li>How will my rules for <i>cross-module overloading</i> look like?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Todo</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Can I / Should I define subsets of the language like D's @safe, @trusted, @system? @substrate perhaps?</li>
<li>Another idea is to put all the "unsafe" features in separate modules, so that unsafe code can be identified by looking at the imports at the beginning of the file.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">A tool could start at the root module and look for imports of "unsafe" features and/or declarations that change the language (including the import semantics) to partition the code into "safe", "unsafe" and "not-sure" regions.</li>
<li>Yet another idea is to allow certain "low level" features only in functions declared as "low level".</li>
<li>Soft Silverwind suggests I take a look at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1422-pub-restricted.md">this</a> proposed Rust feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Ideas</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>A class definition will be splitable to pieces (like partial classes?) and thus distributable to many files, assuming they are all given simultaneously for the creation of a single module as described above.</li>
<li>Could support importing global functions as methods and exporting methods as global functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
