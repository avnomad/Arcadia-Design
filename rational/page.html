<li>Linear data structures could have a <i>length</i>&nbsp;member, but this name doesn't generalize to trees and graphs.</li>
<li>The ↜ and &lt;~ operators were used for assignment, even though they are harder to write than =, because they don't match any mathematical symbol used elsewhere.</li>
<li>The <b>|</b>&nbsp;and <b>||</b>&nbsp;operators weren't used for bitwise and logical disjunction respectively because the former was needed for conditional probability and the parallel to test whether two lines or vectors were parallel.</li>
<li>Only arithmetic and geometric progressions are recognized by the sequence operator ( , ,..., ), since there is no point in submitting the readers of the code to an IQ test.</li>
