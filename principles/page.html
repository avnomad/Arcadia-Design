<title>Principles</title>
</head><body><ul><li>If you don't use it, you don't pay for it.</li>
<li>Keep optional features to a minimum, ideally zero.</li>
<li>True Unicode support.</li>
<li>Easy to learn to solve problems writing correct programs. Not too difficult to predict what code is generated and write fast code. Unbounded implementation difficulty.</li>
<li>Views, substitutability and deferred decitions.</li>
<li>All operators have to be familiar (have to be used somewhere else already). "No originality" rule?</li>
<li>It should be possible to redefine the whole language from within the language. Not necessarily easy...</li>
</ul>
